# Contributing to Harbor CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Harbor CLI project!
We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new features and suggestions.

## Overview

The **Harbor CLI** is a powerful command-line tool to interact with the [Harbor container registry](https://goharbor.io/). It's built in Go and helps users manage Harbor resources like projects, registries, artifacts, and more — directly from their terminal.

## Getting Started

### Run using Container

You can try the CLI immediately using Docker:

```bash
docker run -ti --rm -v $HOME/.harbor/config.yaml:/root/.harbor/config.yaml registry.goharbor.io/harbor-cli/harbor-cli --help
```

### Alias (Optional)

```bash
echo "alias harbor='docker run -ti --rm -v \$HOME/.harbor/config.yaml:/root/.harbor/config.yaml registry.goharbor.io/harbor-cli/harbor-cli'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Build from Source

Make sure [Go](https://go.dev/) is installed (≥ v1.24).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-cli.git && cd harbor-cli
go build -o harbor-cli cmd/harbor/main.go
./harbor-cli --help
```

Alternatively, use [Dagger](https://docs.dagger.io/) for isolated builds:

```bash
dagger call build-dev --platform darwin/arm64 export --path=./harbor-cli
./harbor-dev --help
```

## Local Development Hooks (Lefthook)

This project uses [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to enforce code quality checks automatically on every commit — similar to Husky in JavaScript projects.

### Install Lefthook

```bash
# macOS
brew install lefthook

# Linux / other (via Go)
go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest

# Or download a binary: https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/releases
```

### Activate the hooks (one-time, after cloning)

```bash
lefthook install
```

This registers the Git hooks defined in [`lefthook.yml`](./lefthook.yml). From that point on, every `git commit` will automatically run:

| Hook | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| `gofmt` | All `.go` files are `gofmt`-formatted |
| `golangci-lint` | Linting via the project's `.golangci.yaml` config |
| `go build ./...` | Project compiles without errors |
| `go test ./...` | Full test suite passes |
| DCO sign-off | Commit message contains a `Signed-off-by:` line (requires `git commit -s`) |

### Skipping hooks (use sparingly)

If you need to bypass the hooks for a work-in-progress commit:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "wip: ..."
```

> ⚠️ All of the above checks also run in CI. Skipping locally does not bypass CI.

## How to Contribute

### 1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/harbor-cli.git
cd harbor-cli
```

### 2. Create Your Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<your-feature-name>
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Follow coding and formatting guidelines.

### 4. Test Locally

Ensure your changes work as expected.

```bash
gofmt -s -w .
dagger call build-dev --platform darwin/arm64 export --path=./harbor-cli  #Recommended
./harbor-dev --help
```

If dagger is not installed in your system, you can also build the project using the following commands:

```bash
gofmt -s -w .
go build -o ./bin/harbor-cli cmd/harbor/main.go
./bin/harbor-cli --help
```

### 5. Update Documentation 

Before committing, **always regenerate the documentation** if you've made any code changes or added new commands:

```bash
dagger call run-doc export --path=./doc
```

### 6. Commit with a clear message

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(project): add delete command for project resources"
```

### 7. Push and Open a PR

```bash
git push origin feat/<your-feature-name>
```

Then, [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) on GitHub

## 🧪 Running Tests

> ✅ Note: Add your CLI or unit tests to the `test/` directory.

```bash
go test ./...
```

## 🧹 Code Guidelines

- Use `go fmt ./...` to format your code.
- Use descriptive commit messages:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only
  - `test`: Adding or updating tests
  - `refactor`: Code cleanup
  - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
