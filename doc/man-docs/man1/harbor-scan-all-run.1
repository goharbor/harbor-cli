.SH NAME
harbor-scan-all-run - Scan all artifacts now


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBharbor scan-all run [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Initiate an immediate vulnerability scan of all artifacts in Harbor.

.PP
This command triggers a manual scan of all artifacts across all projects in your Harbor instance.
The scan will check for known vulnerabilities in container images using the configured scanner(s).

.PP
The scan runs asynchronously in the background. After initiating the scan, you can:
  - Check the scan progress with 'harbor-cli scan-all metrics'
  - View results through the Harbor UI

.PP
Important considerations:
  - This operation can be resource intensive on large registries
  - Scanning many artifacts simultaneously may impact system performance
  - The time to complete depends on the number and size of artifacts
  - Only one scan-all operation can run at a time

.PP
Examples:
  # Start scanning all artifacts immediately
  harbor-cli scan-all run

.PP
# Start scanning and monitor progress
  harbor-cli scan-all run && watch -n 0.2 harbor-cli scan-all metrics

.PP
The scan progress and results can be monitored through the metrics command
or through the Harbor web interface.
