.SH NAME
harbor-robot-delete - delete robot by id


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBharbor robot delete [robotID] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Delete a robot account from Harbor.

.PP
This command permanently removes a robot account from Harbor. Once deleted,
the robot's credentials will no longer be valid, and any automated processes
using those credentials will fail.

.PP
The command supports multiple ways to identify the robot account to delete:
- By providing the robot ID directly as an argument
- Without any arguments, which will prompt for robot selection

.PP
Important considerations:
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- All access tokens for the robot will be invalidated immediately
- Any systems using the robot's credentials will need to be updated
- For system robots, access across all projects will be revoked

.PP
Examples:
  # Delete robot by ID
  harbor-cli robot delete 123

.PP
# Interactive deletion (will prompt for robot selection)
  harbor-cli robot delete
