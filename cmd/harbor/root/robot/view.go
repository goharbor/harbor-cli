		Use:   "view [robotID]",
		Short: "get robot by id",
		Long: `View detailed information about a robot account in Harbor.

This command displays comprehensive information about a robot account including
its ID, name, description, creation time, expiration, and the permissions
it has been granted. Supports both system-level and project-level robot accounts.

The command supports multiple ways to identify the robot account:
- By providing the robot ID directly as an argument
- Without any arguments, which will prompt for robot selection

The displayed information includes:
- Basic details (ID, name, description)
- Temporal information (creation date, expiration date, remaining time)
- Security details (disabled status)
- Detailed permissions breakdown by resource and action
- For system robots: permissions across multiple projects are shown separately

System-level robots can have permissions spanning multiple projects, while
project-level robots are scoped to a single project.

Examples:
  # View robot by ID
  harbor-cli robot view 123

  # Interactive selection (will prompt for robot)
  harbor-cli robot view`,
